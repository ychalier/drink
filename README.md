# drink

A (passive) drinking game in Python

## setup

You'll need the module `matplotlib` and also the voice generator module  [Pyttsx](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) for Python 3. You can install it with pip:

    pip install pyttsx3

If it does not work (according to their [documentation](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), some errors might occur on Windows):

    pip install pypiwin32

Then just run the script [drink.py](drink.py). Enter players, change the parameters as you want, and enjoy. At the end, you even get a plot of the drinking distribution among the players! How sweet is that?

*Love.*
